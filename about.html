About- From a studentâ€™s perspective, placements can
bring a wide range of benefits and opportunities.
Training and management of placement is a crucial
part of an educational institution in which most of the
work is done manually.<br><br>
 Manual system in the colleges
requires a lot of manpower and time. With this project
we aim to develop a web portal to solve this issue. The
project is aimed at developing an application for the
placement department of the college.<br><br>
 The system is an
application which will be accessed and effectively used
throughout the organization with proper login enabled.
It can also be used as an application for the Placement
Officers in the college to manage the student
information about placement thus reducing the manual
work and consumes less paperwork. <br><br>
The system also
provides the facility of viewing the personal and
academic information of the student. The system gets
the requested list of candidates for the companies who
would like to recruit the people according to their
eligibility criteria.
<br><br>
 Laravel framework is used to
facilitate the process of making the program
